I study how we can use our knowledge of the brain to develop better artificial intelligence and how we can study learning in artificial intelligence systems to understand the brain.

In addition, I develop methods in artificial intelligence and machine learning to develop new materials, such as materials with high or low friction. Simultaneously, I study how the artificial intelligence develops internal representations - an understanding - for the laws of nature.
