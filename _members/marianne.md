Marianne Fyhn is director of Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity (CINPLA). CINPLA is a strategic research initiative at the MN Faculty at UiO, aiming to reveal mechanisms underlying the brain’s ability to change and learn from experiences. By integrating experimental methods with physics-based computational modelling and analysis, we work to develop a creative and inspiring consortium aiming to deliver groundbreaking research and develop an interdisciplinary and high-quality educational program in Neuroscience at the faculty.
