Welcome to the bioAI group's website!

At the **Biologically-Inspired Artificial Intelligence (bioAI)** research group, we develop brain-inspired AI methods to advance our understanding of brain function and enhance AI technology. Our focus areas include
- spatial navigation
- active sensing
- interpretability
- representation learning
- causality
- continual learning
- analysis of neural data

We are hosted by the [Simula Research Laboratory](https://www.simula.no/about) in collaboration with the [University of Oslo (UiO)](https://www.uio.no/english/about/). We also maintain strong ties with UiO's [Centre for Integrative Neuroplasticity (CINPLA)](https://www.mn.uio.no/ibv/english/research/sections/fyscell/cinpla/about/).

If our research interests align with yours, weâ€™d love to hear from you. [Contact us](mailto:mikkel@simula.no) to learn more.
